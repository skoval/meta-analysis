## Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis

What is an IPD meta-analysis?

*** =instructions
- This is a meta-analysis where all enrolled patients are included.
- This is a pooled analysis with all the raw study data.
- A meta-analysis of one patient per study.


*** =hint
The unit of analysis is different from a standard meta-analysis.

*** =sct
```{r}

msg1 <- "Try again. When only aggregate information is available, it is a standard meta-analysis."
msg2 <- "Exactly. This is a pooled study with data from all the study participants."
msg3 <- "No. This is not a description of a meta-analysis."

test_mc(correct = 2, feedback_msgs = c(msg1, msg2, msg3)) 
```

## Benefits of IPD Meta-Analysis

Which is _not_ a potential benefit of IPD meta-analysis?

*** =instructions
- Investigating patient-treatment interactions.
- Harmonizing variable definitions.
- Preventing missing data.


*** =hint
Harmonizing variable definitions is an advantage.

*** =sct
```{r}

msg1 <- "Try again. With patient data, we can investigate how patient factors influence treatment effects."
msg2 <- "No. This is a major advantage of an IPD meta-analysis."
msg3 <- "Correct. An IPD analysis cannot eliminate missing data."

test_mc(correct = 3, feedback_msgs = c(msg1, msg2, msg3)) 
```

## Performing One-Step Meta-Analysis

In this exercise, you will perform a pooled meta-analysis and examine between-study heterogeneity.

*** =instructions
- The dataset `normand1999` contains pooled data for 9 studies.
- The outcome is the length of stay (in days) among hospital patients.
- The purpose of the meta-analysis is to obtain an overall summary of the typical length of stay.
- Use a Poisson regression and determine the significance of between-study effects.
- Save the model as `fit`.


*** =hint
Use `glm` for the model.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
set.seed(11115)
library(metafor)
data(dat.normand1999)

los <- unlist(mapply(function(n, m, s){
	rnorm(n, m, s)
}, n = dat.normand1999$n1i, m = dat.normand1999$m1i, s = dat.normand1999$sd1i))

normand1999 <- data.frame(
	study = rep(1:9, dat.normand1999$n1i),
	los = ceiling(ifelse(los < 0, 1, los))
)
```


*** =solution
```{r}
fit <- glm(los ~ factor(study), data = normand1999,
	family = "poisson")

summary(fit)
anova(fit, test = "Chisq") # Test for between-study differences
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_function("glm", args = "family", not_called_msg = "You should use the family argument of the glm function.")
success_msg("Great job. You have a good understanding of patient-data meta-analysis.")
```

## Performing Two-Step Meta-Analysis

Using the `normand1999` dataset, obtain the log-rate for each study and fit the DerSimonian-Laird meta-analysis.


*** =instructions
- Use `glm` and the Poisson regression for each log-rate.
- Store the result in `data` and call the outcome `yi` and variance `vi`.
- Fit a DL meta-analysis with the `rma` function.


*** =hint
Use `rma` with `DL` method for the meta-analysis.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
set.seed(11115)
library(metafor)
data(dat.normand1999)

los <- unlist(mapply(function(n, m, s){
	rnorm(n, m, s)
}, n = dat.normand1999$n1i, m = dat.normand1999$m1i, s = dat.normand1999$sd1i))

normand1999 <- data.frame(
	study = rep(1:9, dat.normand1999$n1i),
	los = ceiling(ifelse(los < 0, 1, los))
)
```


*** =solution
```{r}
split_data <- split(normand1999, f = factor(normand1999$study))

data <- do.call("rbind", lapply(split_data, function(obj){
	fit <- glm(los ~ 1, data = obj, family = poisson)
	data.frame(
		yi = coef(fit),
		vi = vcov(fit)[1,1]
	)
}))

fit <- rma(yi = yi, vi = vi, data = data, method = "DL")
summary(fit)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("data")
test_function("rma", args = "method", not_called_msg = "You should use the rma function.")
success_msg("Fantastic! You have mastered IPD meta-analysis.")

## Rare Events

Examine the dataset `dat.bcg`. Are rare events a concern for this meta-analysis?

*** =instructions
- Yes.
- No.

*** =hint
Rare events are when the events are close or equal to zero for some groups.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(metafor)
data(dat.bcg)
```


*** =sct
```{r}

msg1 <- "Correct. Some groups have fewer than 5 events, so rare-event effects are a concern."
msg2 <- "Wrong.  There are ver few events for some groups."

test_mc(correct = 1, feedback_msgs = c(msg1, msg2)) 
```

data(dat.bcg)
```


*** =solution
