   \item{exact}{logical indicating whether an exact permutation test should be carried out or not (default is \code{FALSE}). See \sQuote{Details}.}
   \item{iter}{integer specifying the number of iterations for the permutation test when not doing an exact test (default is 1000 iterations).}
   \item{progbar}{logical indicating whether a progress bar should be shown (default is \code{TRUE}).}
   \item{retpermdist}{logical indicating whether the permutation distributions of the test statistics should be returned (default is \code{FALSE}).}

   \item{tol}{numerical tolerance used when making \code{>=} or \code{<=} comparisons between an observed test statistic and the test statistic under the permuted data. Defaults to \code{.Machine$double.eps^0.5} if unspecified. See \sQuote{Note}.}

\details{
   For models without moderators, the permutation test is carried out by permuting the signs of the observed effect sizes or outcomes. The (two-sided) p-value of the permutation test is then equal to two times the proportion of times that the test statistic under the permuted data is as extreme or more extreme than under the actually observed data. See Follmann and Proschan (1999) for more details.

   For models with moderators, the permutation test is carried out by permuting the rows of the model matrix (i.e., \eqn{\mathbf{X}}{X}). The (two-sided) p-value for a particular model coefficient is then equal to two times the proportion of times that the test statistic for the coefficient under the permuted data is as extreme or more extreme than under the actually observed data. Similarly, for the omnibus test, the p-value is the proportion of times that the test statistic for the omnibus test is as extreme or more extreme than the actually observed one. See Higgins and Thompson (2004) and Viechtbauer et al. (in press) for more details.

   If \code{exact=TRUE}, the function will try to carry out an exact permutation test. An exact permutation test requires fitting the model to each possible permutation once. However, the number of possible permutations increases rapidly with the number of outcomes/studies (i.e., \eqn{k}). For models without moderators, there are \eqn{2^k} possible permutations of the signs. Therefore, for \eqn{k=5}, there are 32 possible permutations, for \eqn{k=10}, there are already 1024, and for \eqn{k=20}, there are over one million permutations of the signs.

   For models with moderators, the increase in the number of possible permutations may be even more severe. The total number of possible permutations of the model matrix is \eqn{k!}. Therefore, for \eqn{k=5}, there are 120 possible permutations, for \eqn{k=10}, there are 3,628,800, and for \eqn{k=20}, there are over \eqn{10^{18}}{10^18} permutations of the model matrix.

   Therefore, going through all possible permutations may become infeasible. Instead of using an exact permutation test, one can set \code{exact=FALSE} (which is also the default). In that case, the function approximates the exact permutation-based p-value(s) by going through a smaller number (as specified by the \code{iter} argument) of \emph{random} permutations. Therefore, running the function twice on the same data will yield (slightly) different p-values. Setting \code{iter} sufficiently large ensures that the results become stable. Note that if \code{exact=FALSE} and \code{iter} is actually larger than the number of iterations required for an exact permutation test, then an exact test will be carried out.

   For models with moderators, the exact permutation test actually only requires fitting the model to each \emph{unique} permutation of the model matrix. The number of unique permutations will be smaller than \eqn{k!} when the model matrix contains recurring rows. This may be the case when only including categorical moderators (i.e., factors) in the model or when any quantitative moderators included in the model only take on a small number of unique values. When \code{exact=TRUE}, the function therefore uses an algorithm to restrict the test to only the unique permutations of the model matrix, which may make the use of the exact test feasible even when \eqn{k} is large.

   When using random permutations, the function ensures that the very first permutation will always correspond to the original data. This avoids p-values equal to 0.
}
\value{
   An object of class \code{"permutest.rma.uni"}. The object is a list containing the following components:
   \item{pval}{p-value(s) based on the permutation test.}
   \item{QMp}{p-value for the omnibus test of coefficients based on the permutation test.}
   \item{zval.perm}{values of the test statistics of the coefficients under the various permutations (only when \code{retpermdist=TRUE}).}
   \item{QM.perm}{values of the test statistic for the omnibus test of coefficients under the various permutations (only when \code{retpermdist=TRUE}).}
   \item{\dots}{some additional elements/values are passed on.}

   The results are formated and printed with the \code{\link{print.permutest.rma.uni}} function. One can also use \code{\link{coef.permutest.rma.uni}} to obtain the table with the model coefficients, corresponding standard errors, test statistics, p-values, and confidence interval bounds.
}
\note{
   It is important to note that the p-values obtained with permutation tests cannot reach conventional levels of statistical significance (i.e., \eqn{p \le .05}) when \eqn{k} is very small. In particular, for models without moderators, the smallest possible (two-sided) p-value is .0625 when \eqn{k=5} and .03125 when \eqn{k=6}. Therefore, the permutation test is only able to reject the null hypothesis at \eqn{\alpha=.05} when \eqn{k} is at least equal to 6. For models with moderators, the smallest possible (two-sided) p-value for a particular model coefficient is .0833 when \eqn{k=4} and .0167 when \eqn{k=5} (assuming that each row in the model matrix is unique). Therefore, the permutation test is only able to reject the null hypothesis at \eqn{\alpha=.05} when \eqn{k} is at least equal to 5.

   When the number of permutations required for the exact test is so large as to be essentially indistinguishable from infinity (e.g., \code{factorial(200)}), the function will terminate with an error.

   Determining whether a test statistic under the permuted data is as extreme or more extreme than under the actually observed data requires making \code{>=} or \code{<=} comparisons. To avoid problems due to the finite precision with which computers generally represent numbers, the function uses a numerical tolerance when making such comparisons (e.g., instead of \code{sqrt(3)^2 - 3 >= 0}, which may evaluate to \code{FALSE}, we can use \code{sqrt(3)^2 - 3 >= 0 - .Machine$double.eps^0.5}, which should evaluate to \code{TRUE}).
