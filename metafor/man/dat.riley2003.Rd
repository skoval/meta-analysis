\details{
   The meta-analysis by Riley et al. (2003) examined a variety of prognostic markers for overall and disease-free survival in patients with neuroblastoma. One of the markers examined was amplified levels of the MYC-N protein, with is associated with poorer outcomes.

   The dataset given here was extracted from Riley (2011) and has been used in several other publications (e.g., Riley et al., 2004, 2007). The dataset provides the (log) hazard ratios (and corresponding standard errors) with respect to these two outcomes in 81 studies, with positive values indicating a greater risk of death (for OS) or disease recurrence/death (for DFS) for patients with high MYC-N levels compared to those with normal/low levels. Note that information on both outcomes could only be extracted from 17 studies (39 studies only provided sufficient information to extract the OS estimate, while 25 studies only allowed for extraction of the DFS estimate).
