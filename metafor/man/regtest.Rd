\details{
   Various tests for funnel plot asymmetry have been suggested in the literature, including the rank correlation test by Begg and Mazumdar (1994) and the regression test by Egger et al. (1997). Extensions, modifications, and further developments of the regression test are described (among others) by Macaskill, Walter, and Irwig (2001), Sterne and Egger (2005), Harbord, Egger, and Sterne (2006), Peters et al. (2006), Rücker, Schwarzer, and Carpenter (2008), and Moreno et al. (2009). The various versions of the regression test differ in terms of the model (either a regular weighted regression with a multiplicative dispersion term or one of the meta-analytic models is used), in terms of the independent variable that the observed outcomes are hypothesized to be related to when publication bias is present (suggested predictors include the standard error, the sampling variance, the sample size, and the inverse of the sample size), and in terms of the outcome measure used (e.g., for \eqn{2 \times 2}{2x2} table data, one has the choice between various outcome measures). The idea behind the various tests is the same though: If there is a relationship between the observed outcomes and the chosen predictor, then this usually implies asymmetry in the funnel plot, which in turn may be an indication of publication bias.

   The \code{regtest.rma} function can be used to carry out various versions of the regression test. The model is chosen via the \code{model} argument, with \code{model="lm"} for weighted regression with a multiplicative dispersion term or \code{model="rma"} for the meta-analytic models. In the latter case, arguments such as \code{method}, \code{weighted}, and \code{knha} used during the initial model fitting are also used for the regression test. Therefore, if one wants to conduct the regression test with a random/mixed-effects model, one should first fit a random-effects model with the \code{rma} function and then use the \code{regtest.rma} function on the fitted model object.

   The predictor is chosen via the \code{predictor} argument:
   \itemize{
   \item \code{predictor="sei"} for the standard error,
   \item \code{predictor="vi"} for the sampling variance,
   \item \code{predictor="ni"} for the sample size,
   \item \code{predictor="ninv"} for the inverse of the sample size,
   \item \code{predictor="sqrtni"} for the square-root transformed sample size, and
   \item \code{predictor="ninv"} for the inverse of the square-root transformed sample size.
   } For predictors based on the sample size, the object \code{x} obviously must contain the information about the sample sizes. This will automatically be the case when \code{measure} was \emph{not} equal to \code{"GEN"} or the \code{ni} values were explicitly specified during the initial model fitting.

   Finally, depending on what outcome measure was used for the model fitting will determine which outcome measure is used for the regression test.
}
\value{
   An object of class \code{"regtest.rma"}. The object is a list containing the following components:
   \item{model}{the model used for the regression test.}
   \item{predictor}{the predictor used for the regression test.}
   \item{zval}{the value of the test statistic.}
   \item{pval}{the corresponding p-value}
   \item{dfs}{the degrees of freedom of the test stastistic (if the test is based on a t-distribution).}
   \item{fit}{the full results from the fitted model.}

   The results are formated and printed with the \code{\link{print.regtest.rma}} function.
}
\note{
   The classical ``Egger test'' is obtained by setting \code{model="lm"} and \code{predictor="sei"}. For the random/mixed-effects version of the Egger test, one should first fit a random-effects model to the data and then set \code{model="rma"} and \code{predictor="sei"} when using the \code{regtest.rma} function. See Sterne and Egger (2005) for details on these two types of models/tests.

   All of the tests do not directly test for publication bias, but for a relationship between the observed outcomes and the chosen predictor. If such a relationship is present, then this usually implies asymmetry in the funnel plot, which in turn may be an indication of publication bias. However, it is important to keep in mind that there can be other reasons besides publication bias that could lead to asymmetry in the funnel plot.
