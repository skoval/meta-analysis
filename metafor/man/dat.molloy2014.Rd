\details{
   Conscientiousness, one of the big-5 personality traits, can be defined as \dQuote{socially prescribed impulse control that facilitates task- and goal-directed behaviour, such as thinking before acting, delaying gratification, following norms and rules and planning, organising and prioritising tasks} (John & Srivastava, 1999). Conscientiousness has been shown to be related to a number of health-related behaviors (e.g., tobacco/alcohol/drug use, diet and activity patterns, risky behaviors). A recent meta-analysis by Molloy et al. (2014) examined to what extent conscientiousness is related to medication adherence, that is, the extent to which (typically chronically ill) patients follow a prescribed medication regimen (e.g., taking a daily dose of a cholesterol lowering drug in patients with high LDL serum cholesterol levels). The results from the 16 studies included in this meta-analysis are provided in this dataset.

   Variable \code{a_measure} indicates whether adherence was measured based on self-reports or a more \sQuote{objective} measure (e.g., electronic monitoring of pill bottle openings, pill counts). Variable \code{c_measure} indicates whether conscientiousness was measured with some version of the NEO personality inventory or some other scale. Methodological quality was scored by the authors on a 1 to 4 scale with higher scores indicating higher quality (see article for details on how this score was derived).
