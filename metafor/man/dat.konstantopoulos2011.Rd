\details{
   Instead of following the more traditional school calendar with a long summer break (in addition to a short winter and spring break), some schools have switched to a modified school calendar comprising more frequent but shorter intermittent breaks (e.g., 9 weeks of school followed by 3 weeks off), while keeping the total number of days at school approximately the same. The effects of using such a modified calendar on student achievement have been examined in a number of studies and were meta-analyzed by Cooper et al. (2003).

   The dataset (taken from Konstantopoulos, 2011) contains the results from 56 studies, each comparing the level of academic achievement in a group of students following a modified school calendar with that of a group of students following a more traditional school calendar. The difference between the two groups was quantified in terms of a standardized mean difference (with positive values indicating a higher mean level of achievement in the group following the modified school calendar).
   
   The studies were conducted at various schools that were clustered within districts. The data therefore have a multilevel structure, with schools nested within districts. A multilevel meta-analysis of these data can be used to estimate and account for the amount of heterogeneity between districts and between schools within districts.
